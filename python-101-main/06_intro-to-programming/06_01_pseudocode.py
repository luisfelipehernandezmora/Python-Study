# Your cat just had kittens! Now you want to put up an ad to give them
# to your friends. You'll need to save all names of the kittens,
# confirm that they each of them is cute, and show a message that
# that kitten is ready for adoption.
#
# Break this task up into a couple of steps of pseudocode
# and write the pseudocode below in code comments.
# You don't need to write any functional code, just map out the steps.

#Luis Answer:

# Make a list, that ask the user the names of the cat's
# 
# Taking, each cat name, ask the user a message: "Hello! the cat"+"_name here_"+"is cute? (Y/N)"
# 
# Make a conditional if cat is cute, say "is ready for adoption", if not, say "Oh, give it one more
# week and it will be adorable"
