# Think about a task that you want to accomplish using programming
# Maybe you want to automate something you do every day on your computer?
# Break down some of the steps you can think of and write them in
# this file as pseudocode.
# You can come back and update this file when you've learned more.
# You can also add real Python code after learning the necessary concepts.
# For now, just practice breaking larger tasks into smaller steps
# and writing out your thoughts in pseudocode.

# So I work as a civil enginner on a construction, and something interesting can be an 
# automatic expense calculator, that with some input, just record WHAT, HOW MUCH, IN WHICH STORE AND 
# DEDICATED TO WHICH CONSTRUCTIVE ACTIVITY an expense take place
#
# For this I must give some input each time I buy something, this will include: Price, tax?, shop, activity,
# and bill number. 
# 
# If there is a previous budget the money from each bill can be charged by constructive activity and go filling
# a percentage as time goes (so you know when you exceed some activity)
# 
# but for tax matters, the software should collect bill number, shop, amount and make an organized list by date
# and also to save a pdf of the bill
# 
# then each tax payment period, the software should give all the bills collected by the system, and 
# like that you know what to pay in a more organized way

# Adiotionally, you can put as an optional input, what specific detail (example: Gypsum boards, nails, toilets
# paint products, pipes tools, etc..) is in each bill, and next time you need to purchase something, the 
# software ask you the product, search in the purchased Items, and if bought before, displays the existing 
# bill so you have a reference of price and which shop sold it to you, even contact information. And from 
# here you can develop a further more advanced software that helps you price products in diferent shops.
