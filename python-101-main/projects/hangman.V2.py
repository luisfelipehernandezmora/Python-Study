# Write a Hangman game in Python.
# Users should have a limited amount of attempts to guess a pre-defined word.
# Print feedback to the user when they made a guess,
# and keep track of and communicate their remaining attempts.
# Hard-code a word that needs to be guessed in the script
# Print an explanation to the user
# Display the word as a sequence of blanks, e.g. "_ _ _ _ _" for "hello"
# Ask for user input
# Allow only single-character alphabetic input
# Create a counter for how many tries a user has
# Keep asking them for their guess until they won or lost
# When they find a correct character, display the blank with the word
#   filled in, e.g.: "_ e _ _ _" if they guessed "e" from "hello"
# Display a winning message and the full word if they win
# Display a losing message and quit the game if they don't make it
